# CV

A web-based professional resume built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Local Development

Open `index.html` in a browser, or run a local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000

## Deployment

This site is designed for GitHub Pages:

1. Push code to the `main` branch
2. Go to Settings > Pages
3. Set source to "Deploy from a branch" and select `main` / `root`

Your resume will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/cv/`

## Customization

Edit `index.html` to update your information. Modify `css/styles.css` to change colors and styling - look for the `:root` section for theme variables.
